# Object Viewer

Pass models into a generic method addModel('') and change it to call addModel() on update in addition to init(); 

# Prime Growth

Iterates over a sequence of primes P, length N, where P contains the first N prime numbers starting at 2. This then renders a 3D model, where the 'wings' of the object scale at P(i)/P(N), where P(i) is the i'th prime in a sequence of primes, and P(N) is the last prime in the sequence.

# Tweet Viewer

Using the libs from the Object Viewer, Prime Growth, and chalms/node-tweet-js library, this _will_ (not finished) render an animation based on the data contained in a stream of tweets.
